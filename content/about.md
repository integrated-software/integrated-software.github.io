My name is **Andy**, I am currently a highschool senior.
I started this blog in preperation for college.
I hope to have a lot of fun using hugo!


## Interests and Hobbies.
I have few interests in life, and most of them having to do with programming.

* Compiler design.
* Operating systems development.
* Concurrency based programming.
* Object oriented programming.

If I had to pick a single interest out of this list, I would pick **compiler design**.
Compilers have always interested me, how they work, how to make them and, all the amazing stuff they can do.


## Plans for the future.
I hope to pursue higher-education in <mark>computer science</mark>.
And, hopefully a bachelors in it.

Currently as I am writing this section, I'm still working on my common application.
I hope to get that done soon. I also hope to get admitted by my college of choice :)
